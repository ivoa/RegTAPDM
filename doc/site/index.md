RegTAP Data Model
==================

This is a VO-DML formulation of the data model described in the [RegTAP Standard](https://www.ivoa.net/documents/RegTAP/), and has been created to provide a machine-readable representation of that data model. The motivation for doing this is to be able to then create XSLT that will translate VOResource XML instances into RegTAP XML instances in a platform independent fashion, so that there is a standard implementation of these transformations described in the RegTAP standard.

The practical use of this code is that it can be used as part of the ingestion pipeline in a full searchable registry for transforming from an OAI-PMH response to the tables for a TAP interface on that registry.

## The Transformation

The transformation from a VOResource XML instance to a RegTAP XML instance is done with [this XSLT](https://github.com/ivoa/RegTAPDM/blob/master/src/main/resources/convertToRegTap.xsl).


## The Java Implementation

As well as containing the standard Java code of the model (as generated by the [VO-DML tooling](https://github.com/ivoa/vo-dml)), the [Java implementation](./generated/javadoc) also includes some utility classes to make running the transformation easier, as well as functionality to save those instances to a relational database.
