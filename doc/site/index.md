RegTAP Data Model
==================

This is a VO-DML formulation of the data model described in the [RegTAP Standard](https://www.ivoa.net/documents/RegTAP/), and has been created to provide a machine-readable representation of that data model. The motivation for doing this is to be able to then create XSLT that will translate VOResource XML instances into RegTAP XML instances in a platform independent fashion, so that there is a standard implementation of these transformations described in the RegTAP standard.
